# Learn Web Push Notifications

I just follow (this tutorial)[https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/push-notifications] and convert it to HTML.

But, when I try with HTML file, it's not work because it needs http or https scheme. So, I use PHP built in server.

## How to run
Run `php -S localhost:8000` in terminal and access the URL in browser.
